Overexpression of GAS8-AS1 inhibited proliferation, significantly increased the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, and reduced p62 expression, whereas GAS8-AS1 knockdown demonstrated opposite effects. In GAS8-AS1 overexpressing cell lines, LC3 immunofluorescence staining demonstrated increased punctate aggregates of LC3 staining, and transmission electron microscopy revealed increased numbers of autophagosomes. Autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) was markedly upregulated by GAS8-AS1 overexpression and downregulated by GAS8-AS1 knockdown. Finally, silencing of ATG5 attenuated autophagy activation and rescued the inhibition of cell proliferation caused by GAS8-AS1. In PTC cell lines, GAS8-AS1 inhibited proliferation, activated autophagy, and increased ATG5 expression. Downregulation of ATG5 reversed GAS8-AS1-mediated activation of autophagy leading to cell death, revealing a novel mechanism of the GAS8-AS1-ATG5 axis in PTC cell lines. This provided a new experimental basis to explore the effects of lncRNA on autophagy in the treatment of thyroid cancer.",,,

The HOTAIR was then over-expressed in chondrocytes by transfecting recombinant lentivirus carrying sequences encoding HOTAIR. The LPS-induced reduction of cell proliferation rate and production of two inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-17, IL-23 were markedly inhibited. Enforced expression of HOTAIR also led to the upregulation of proliferation-related protein Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Moreover, a negative correlation was detected between the expression of HOTAIR and microRNA (miR)-138, and the expression of miR-138 was significantly increased in LPS-induced chondrocytes. The effects of HOTAIR over-expression on the proliferation and inflammation were partly reversed by miR-138 overexpression. Furthermore, the overexpression of HOTAIR significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) in LPS-treated chondrocytes by suppressing p65 to cell nucleus, resulting in the down-regulation of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In addition, the in vivo experiments exhibited that overexpression of HOTAIR increased cell proliferation and inhibited inflammation in RA rats, which were demonstrated by upregulation of Ki67 and PCNA, reduced CD4+IL-17+,CD4+IL-23+ cells, and down-regulation of p-p65, IL-1β and TNF-α. In summary, our study suggests HOTAIR plays a protective role in RA by increasing proliferation rate and inhibiting inflammation, which may be related with the regulation of miR-138 expression and NF-κB signaling pathway.

Knockdown of PVT1 in cisplatin-resistant CRC cells induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis, whereas overexpression of PVT1 increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of CRC cells. Mechanically, the levels of drug resistance-associated molecules, including multidrug resistance 1 and multidrug resistance protein 1, as well as the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 were significantly downregulated whereas the levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were increased in PVT1-silenced cisplatin-resistant CRC cells.

Furthermore, we found that SNHG7 knockdown remarkably suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of A172 and U87 cells while inducing their apoptosis. Subsequently, we showed that SNHG7 knockdown significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo by using xenograft experiments in nude mice. In terms of mechanism, we found that SNHG7 directly inhibited miR-5095, which targeted the 3' UTR of CTNNB1 mRNA and subsequently downregulated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in GBM. Using rescue experiments, we demonstrated that SNHG7 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of GBM cells through the inhibition of miR-5095 and concomitant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",,,

Bioinformatic analysis predicted that SNHG7 harboured miR-193b-binding sites, and we found decreased miR-193b levels in NSCLC tissues when compared to relative normal tissues. Luciferase assays indicated that overexpression of miR-193b inhibited the Ruc expression of plasmid with miR-193b-binding sites of SNHG7 in a dose-dependent manner. Ectopically expressed SNHG7 also as a molecular sponge sequestered endogenous miR-193b. Besides, FAIM2 was found to be directly targeted by miR-193b. The restoration of miR-193b levels in NSCLC cell lines A549 and H125 suppressed the expression of FAIM2 and related tumour proliferation, metastasis and induced apoptosis. However, forced expression of SNHG7 could down-regulate miR-193b to elevate the FAIM2 level of tumour cells, leading to impaired miR-193b/FAIM2-induced tumour progression. Knockdown of SNHG7 in vivo significantly delayed the tumour growth with decreased tumour volume, which accompanied with enhanced miR-193b expression and reduced FAIM2 levels.",,,
"2022","SNHG7","stomach cancer","48 cases of gastric cancer tissues and 5 gastric cancer cell lines","Regulation [up-regulated]","qRT-PCR//CCK-8 assay//Flow Cytometry//Western blot","The qRT-PCR experiment showed that in a total of 68 cases of cancer tissues and tumor-adjacent tissues, the relative expression of SNHG7 was upregulated in 48 cases of gastric cancer tissues and 5 gastric cancer cell lines. The in vitro experiments showed that after SNHG7 expression was interfered, the proliferation of gastric cancer cells was inhibited with an increase in apoptotic rate and arrest of cell cycle in G1/G0 phase. Experiment on nude-mouse transplanted tumor model confirmed that after SNHG7 expression was interfered, in vivo tumor growth was inhibited, and the Western blotting assay revealed that regulation of p15 and p16 expressions constituted a part of the potential molecular mechanism.",,,
